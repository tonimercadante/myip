# MyIp

Script to get your external ip address.

I had the need to find out what my external ip addresses was and I was learning about web scraping with python, so I made this small but useful script using beautiful soup 4

This script uses the http://www.meuip.com/ website to grab the data, then uses beatifull soup to parse it. 

Simples script para pegar o seu ip externo.
O script consulta o site: http://www.meuip.com/ para obter as informa√ßes e o beautiful soup 4 para fazer o parse dos dados.
